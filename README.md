# Manuscript-DNA-for-Early-Modern-Poetry-Collections
Hackathon prototype building “Manuscript DNA” from ~160k early modern poetry transcriptions using bibliographic metadata + selected lines. Created embedding-based collection fingerprints, compared miscellanies via cosine similarity and clustering, and flagged Yale Osborn MS fb 217 as a strong genre outlier; identified a Psalms cluster.
